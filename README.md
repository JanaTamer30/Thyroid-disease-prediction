This project aims to classify thyroid diseases using machine learning models based on patient data. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes features like age, sex, TSH, T3, TT4, T4U, and FTI levels, along with a target variable representing different thyroid subdiseases.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, removed irrelevant features, and encoded categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed feature distributions and correlations to identify relevant features.
Model Building:
Implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest models.
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results:
Logistic Regression was chosen for its strong performance and balanced accuracy.
The final Logistic Regression model was saved and deployed for real-time inference, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning for thyroid disorders.# Thyroid-disease-prediction
